# Friendly VN Club

Abstract: In this document I outline the idea and practical implementation of the Friendly VN Club Contest where members of the club will create VNs of similar length and scale in the same allotted time using R\*n'py (A simple to use VN engine) and the same assets (created by me or anyone elso who wants to contribute). The aim is to have fun together! This is intented as a trial run sort of deal; there's no telling if this will be fun or even if anyone will actually do it so if it sucks I'll take responsibility and call the whole thing off after or during the trial round.

## Overview
The idea is that I will provide different *themes* from which every member will pick one and implement a short VN (max 10 A4 pages of dialogue[^word_count]) using it. The maximum limit is truly a maximum! 5 pages is more than enough, 2 pages is plenty, half a page is just ok :). Themes will include textures for characters as well as backgrounds for scenes. After everyone submits their work (deadline TBA), I will host all of the works somewhere and we'll play/read through each other's work. Feedback or a ranking can be implemented if someone wants that, stuff like that would all happen anynomously though so no one would end up feeling bad. If the trial round works out maybe I'll give a 50 euro prize to whoever makes the best one according to a vote by members teehee though idk lol. Ideally I am looking for 5 people do complete the trial round :).

## Participation

### Sign-up
You can sign up by contacting me via e-mail (see section [contact](#contact) in this document) or any other venue you know. I recommend trying out what development with R\*npy would be like (see section *Working with R\*n'py* in this document) before signing up.  I also ask that you only sign up if you think you have the time required to dedicate to the rounds, though there will be no penalty for not completing a round or quitting in the middle and you won't be blacklisted or anything dw.

### Getting the assets
Each theme will include 4 characters with 12 textures each.

This (trial)round's themes are:
+ Family (download)
+ Dog World (download)
+ Angel Academy (download)

These assets can be fetched as zip files through the links above or manually navigated to on this project's github page at [github.com/lumitalola/friendly-vn-club](github.com/lumitalola/friendly-vn-club).

### Working with R\*n'py
R\*n'py is genuinely very easy to use after like 1 hour of practice. Please refer to the guide I wrote for this purpose at [lumitalola.github.io/guide](guide.md). A sample project that uses assets from one of the themes can be found at (link). Reading throught it and running it should give you a good idea of how to get started making your own VNs! R\*n'py allows for more complex and branched narratives that feature player choise as well as linear ones. For learning about these refer to the official R\*n'py documentation at [https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/).

Thank you for reading this document! <3

[^word_count]: 5 pages of A4 dialogue should be about 2,500 words. So if you put your script file into a word counter (e.g. [https://wordcounter.net/](https://wordcounter.net/)) and get around 5,000 words then you know you're just about at the limit
