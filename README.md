# Friendly VN Club

Abstract: In this document I outline the idea and practical implementation of the Friendly VN Club Contest where members of the club will create VNs of similar length and scale in the same allotted time using R\*n'py (A simple to use VN engine) and the same assets (created by sig.). The aim is to have fun together! This is intented as a trial run sort of deal, there's no telling if this will be fun or even if anyone will actually do it.
