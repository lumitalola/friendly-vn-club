# Friendly VN Club

Abstract: In this document I outline the idea and practical implementation of the Friendly VN Club Contest where members of the club will create VNs of similar length and scale in the same allotted time using R\*n'py (A simple to use VN engine) and the same assets (created by me or anyone elso who wants to contribute). The aim is to have fun together! This is intented as a trial run sort of deal; there's no telling if this will be fun or even if anyone will actually do it so if it sucks I'll take responsibility and call the whole thing off after or during the trial round.

## Overview


## Participation

### Sign-up
You can sign up by contacting . I recommend trying out what development with R\*npy would be like (see section *Working with R\*n'py* in this document) before signing up.  I also ask that you only sign up if you think you have the time required to dedicate to the rounds, though there will be no penalty for not completing a round or quitting in the middle and you'll be allowed to sign up for future rounds.

### Getting the assets
Each theme will include 4 characters with 12 textures each.

This (trial)round's themes are:
+ Family (download)
+ Dog World (download)
+ Angel Academy (download)

These assets can be fetched as zip files through the links above or manually navigated to on this project's github page at [github.com/lumitalola/friendly-vn-club](github.com/lumitalola/friendly-vn-club).

### Working with R\*n'py
R\*n'py is genuinely very easy to use after like 1 hour of practice. Please refer to the guide I wrote for this purpose at [lumitalola.github.io/guide](guide.md)
